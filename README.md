### Expert C Programming - Deep C Secrets

This repository is intended as a base for the things I learn and try out as I
read through the [Expertc C Programming](http://www.amazon.com/Expert-Programming-Peter-van-Linden/dp/0131774298)
book.

If you are into C programming, get the book and try the programming challenges yourself
before peeking the code. :-)
